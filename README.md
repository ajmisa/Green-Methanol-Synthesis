# Integrated CO₂ Capture and Methanol Synthesis from Cement Plant Flue Gas

This repository presents a detailed process design and techno-economic assessment for converting captured CO₂ from cement plant flue gas into sustainable methanol using green hydrogen. Developed as part of the **6EMA05 Advanced Process Design** course at TU/e, the study aims to support industrial decarbonization through Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) strategies.

## Project Overview

The project integrates:
- **MEA-based post-combustion CO₂ capture** from cement flue gas.
- **Direct CO₂ hydrogenation to methanol** using green H₂.
- **Process simulation and energy integration** in Aspen Plus™ and Aspen Energy Analyzer.
- **Techno-economic analysis** under various market scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Source**: CEMEX cement plant in Rüdersdorf, Germany  
- **Capture Process**: Chemical absorption with 30 wt% MEA; 85% recovery and 99% purity  
- **Methanol Synthesis**: Plug-flow reactor at 260°C and 50 bar over Cu/Zn/Al/Zr catalyst  
- **Energy Integration**: Achieved a 66.7% reduction in utility costs  
- **Economic Viability**: Realistic and optimistic scenarios yield NPVs of €600M and €1B respectively  

## Process Highlights

- **Annual Capacity**:
  - Methanol: ~97.1 kton  
  - Captured CO₂: ~159 kton  
  - Green H₂: ~20.5 kton

- **Simulation Tools**: Aspen Plus™, Aspen Energy Analyzer  
- **Thermodynamic Models**: ELECNRTL, RK-Soave, NRTL  
- **Reaction Kinetics**: Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW)
